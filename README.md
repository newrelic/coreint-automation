## Automatic releases block endpoint 

This repo exposes a github page from the `gh_page` branch containing a file `automatic_release_enable` which is used as a block endpoint.
Automatic pre-releases executes a GET request to it and fails if the status response is different than 200.

The block mechanism can be manually set by manually executing the workflow [Block automatic releases](.github/workflows/block.yaml) and unset by the workflow [Unblock automatic releases](.github/workflows/unblock.yaml) from the Actions panel.
